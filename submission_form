- Introduction
The focus of the project is studying screens and coverages and how they significantly influence the dynamics of the games under evaluation.

- Purpose & Motivation
As some teams may already be effectively using this play, others might encounter additional challenges while creating effective strategies 
and determining appropriate responses when facing it against opposing teams.
The analysis and dashboard made in this project aim to help/guide coaches and staff to chose the best approach while facing and making screens. 
The found results can provide valuable insights while evaluating screen duos, players, type of shots resulted from screens and other events that may occur. 

- Solution
To empower coaches/staff with relevant information, we developed an analysis and a dashboard based in historical data to evaluate the behavior of 
teams and players when a screen occur. 

- Context for how and when to use the application/recommendation
This project serves as a valuable tool for coaches/staff, enabling them to conduct a self evaluation of their own screens. Additionally, it can 
support the evaluation of behavior and screens performance of the opposite team, so it is possible to build/choose defensive techniques that 
effectively counter these strategies.

- Difficulties & Challenges faced during the design and/or development process
1. Lack of mapped data for screens:
- The team had to watch the games to track every screen, what caused a delay in the project. For that reason, by now, the analysis contain only 
one game evaluation. But, once we have this data, we just need to input it in the existent code.
- After manually tracking and inputting the screens, we had to run a code to make sure we were getting the exactly time the screen happens to 
guarantee the accuracy of the data.

- Next steps (if applicable)
1. Map other games' screens (on going)
2. Track the coverage behavior (on going)
